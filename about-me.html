	  My name is <em>Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro</em>.  I'm a
	  computer programmer, system administrator, GNU hacker and
	  free software activist.  I'm vegetarian, atheist and an
	  adept of the full-blooded Platonism school of thought.  I
	  was born on <time datetime="1989-09-12">September 12,
	  1989</time>, in <i>Uberlândia</i>, a municipality in the
	  state of <i>Minas Gerais</i>, <i>Brazil</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
	  There are two main <em>virtues</em> in <em>life</em> that I
	  consider of paramount importance: <em>knowledge</em>
	  and <em>goodwill</em>.  In all aspects of my life, as long
	  as I'm aware of, I pursue the former for the betterment of
	  my own self and uphold the latter for the sake
	  of <em>community</em> and <em>fairness</em>.  Learning is a
	  process of <em>discipline</em> and <em>humility</em>: one
	  needs discipline to learn by oneself and humility to learn
	  from others.  Those are, consequently, virtues which I
	  highly value.  Moreover, in my humble opinion, contributing
	  to the improvement of human <em>social welfare</em> is
	  a <em>moral duty</em> of every capable person, and thus, I
	  make it one of my main goals.  In order to achieve it the
	  solidity of knowledge must be applied, albeit
	  with <em>wisdom</em> and attention to the whole extension of
	  the <em>ethical precepts</em> of goodwill, one of which
	  is <em>freedom</em>.  Only with it we can have a healthy
	  community and ground the basis of <em>justice</em>.  Hence,
	  for me, many aspects of life revolve
	  around <em>liberty</em>, what explains my strong stance on
	  software user's freedom.
	</p>


	<p>
	  I'm a devotee of <em>reason</em> and <em>evidence</em>, and
	  have fostered my analytical and abstract thinking by
	  contemplating and mimicking the <em>logical and mathematical
	  methods</em> of uncovering the <em>truth</em>.  Wherever our
	  human limitations dictate that certainty is unfeasible or
	  impossible to achieve for the time being, the <em>scientific
	  method</em> appears to me as a legitimate and important
	  provision.  I enjoy pretty much all kinds
	  of <em>problem-solving</em> exercises, in special those
	  whose solution doesn't exist and the solver must fallback to
	  the <em>meta-resolution</em> of proving it as such.
	  Interesting enough, the completeness of knowledge seems to
	  me as intrinsically interconnected within itself, making
	  most matters corelated at some non-trivial level.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Although, as a <em>self-taught</em>
	  <em>knowledge-lover</em> individual I'm interested in a wide
	  range of intellectual disciplines, I have a particularly strong
	  interest in <em>Logic</em>, <em>Mathematics</em>, <em>Computer
	    Science</em>, and <em>Physics</em>.  On the other hand, several
	  of the humanities fields, like <em>Philosophy</em>,
	  <em>Politics</em>, <em>Law</em>, <em>Music</em>
	  and <em>Literature</em>, are also appreciated by me.
	  However, I'm an amateur in all those areas having chosen to
	  pursue career as a <em>computer programmer</em>
	  and <em>system administrator</em> because of my long
	  standing affinity with computers.
