I'm a computer programmer, system administrator, GNU hacker and free
software activist with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics.  In the
free software community I work on the development of several projects
of my own making, contribute to other projects, write documentation,
publish technical and philosophical articles, do translation work,
help in infrastructure maintenance and provide support to users.  I
consider myself a good fit for any software development position
because I have the technical skills necessary to get the job done, and
foremost because I'm the kind of person that will put his full
potential into solving the company's problems and making their
projects succeed. By my experience in the free software community,
I've developed excellent communication and coordination skills,
necessary to work productively within development teams of diverse
cultural, philosophical and technical backgrounds.  Below you can find
a list of my published works and past experience that demonstrate my
areas of expertise.  A frequently updated version of my curriculum can
be found online at my
[personal website](http://oitofelix.github.io/curriculum.html).
**Looking forward to work with you!**
