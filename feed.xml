        MININIM is the Advanced Prince of Persia Engine — a childhood
        dream, the free software engine for Jordan Mechner’s
        masterpiece, developed from scratch by Bruno Félix Rezende
        Ribeiro (oitofelix).

        MININIM aims to have detailed documentation on all matters
        concerning the original 1989 Prince of Persia world, ranging
        from its design concepts to the engine’s practical use and
        development.

	The "Free Software Is Even More Important Now" is an article
	by Richard M. Stallman originally published in the Wired
	magazine.  It gives good reasons on why it's a very good idea
	to use free software, for personal, governmental and
	educational use.

      <description>
  QDot 8086 is a mid-level programming language targeting the original
  IBM-PC architecture written as a set of macros for NASM --- the
  Netwide Assembler.  The idea behind it is to make it easy to write
  small, fast, correct and maintainable code in a language almost as
  expressive as C but without giving up all control Assembly language
  grants to programmers.  It features support to functions of an
  arbitrary number of parameters and multiple return values, global
  and function-local variables, loop and conditional flow-control
  constructs, evaluation of arbitrarily complex stack-based
  expressions, symbol importing and primitive debugging.  QDot has
  also a companion standard library that is fully BIOS-based, thus
  OS-independent, which provides array processing, keyboard, video,
  disk and speaker I/O, timing, low-level debugging, math functions,
  user interface procedures and last but not least a versatile
  metamorphic boot-loader, that makes it simple to build a binary that
  is simultaneously a valid DOS executable and a bootable image --- a
  property known as run-within-OS-or-bootstrap-itself-without-OS.

      <description>
  DeciMatrix is a program designed to decode the Matrix into decimal.
  It's a spin-off of the Terminal Matrix 8086's `DCMATRIX` command,
  built into a standalone executable sharing the same metamorphic
  property of run-within-OS-or-bootstrap-itself-without-OS provided by
  the QDot language and its standard library.

      <description>
  Terminal Matrix is a very mysterious program.  It's said that it was
  given to mankind in a spontaneous form of divine inspiration and
  cybernetic insight.  Rumor has it that few people in the entire
  world are able to master and use this program.  Some say, in an
  expression of dubious lucidity, that only the chosen ones can really
  do it.  There are a handful reports of very skilled hackers that
  were able to crack TM's source code and understand the truth that
  has never been seen before, and unlock its full potential.  The only
  truth known for sure, though, is that much is said, but little is
  known.

	Between June and July 2012 I worked with the PlayStation 2
	Linux developers of the PSX Scene community, collaborating and
	sharing experiences, in order to improve the port of Linux 2.6
	to the video game console Sony PlayStation 2.  I improved the
	PS1 memory card support, wrote SBIOS and Linux Multi-tap pad
	drivers, and upgraded kernelloader build system's png2rgb
	image conversion tool to use libpng's 1.5 API.

	Assassinos Matinais is a project of poetry and music comprised
	of a ideology that speaks about platonic love, things
	impossible to achieve, existence, contradiction and truth,
	using a melancholic, critic, ironic and rhetoric tone, in
	which melancholy is defined as the mixed feeling of sadness
	and amusement caused by helplessness in face of an invariable
	and universal truth.
