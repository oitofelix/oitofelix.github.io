## Funding

All my work as a free software programmer is voluntary.  You can
support it by making a donation.  I appreciate contributions of any
size – donations enable me to spend more time working for the free
software community.  If you'd like to make a donation, please use one
of the methods below.  Unfortunately I can’t offer you tax deduction,
but for donations equal or greater than 50 US$, I’d be happy to
acknowledge you in the donors table below.  If you decide to make
recurrent donations, the total amount of your donations will be
updated every month for all records.  If you want recognition, please
send a mail to [oitofelix@gnu.org](mailto:oitofelix@gnu.org) with the
name you wish to be listed, the value you've contributed and for what
software package it's intended (if any).

__Thanks for your support!__
