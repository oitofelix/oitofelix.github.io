## Funding

All my work as a free software programmer, translator and activist is
voluntary.  You can support it by making a donation.  I appreciate
contributions of any size – donations enable me to spend more time
working for the free software community.  If you'd like to make a
donation, of any value, please send it to the following Bitcoin
address:

```

```

Unfortunately I can’t offer you tax deduction, but for all donations
over _0.05 BTC_, I’d be happy to recognize your contribution in the
donors table below.  If you want recognition, please send a mail to
[oitofelix@riseup.net](mailto:oitofelix@riseup.net) with the name and
email you wish to be listed and the value you've contributed.

If you happen to need skilled labor to make particular improvements in
a free software package, work as a system administrator, webmaster,
translator or to provide technical assistance, and think I'd be a good
fit, please don't hesitate to contact me.

__Thanks for your support!__
