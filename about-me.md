## About me

![oitofelix's informal face](/images/oitofelix-informal-face.jpg)

My name is _Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro_.  I'm a computer programmer,
GNU hacker and free software activist.  I'm vegetarian, atheist and an
adept of the full-blooded Platonism school of thought.  I was born on
September 12, 1989, in _Uberlândia_, a municipality in the state of
_Minas Gerais_, _Brazil_.

I'm a devotee of _reason_ and _evidence_, and have fostered my
analytical and abstract thinking by contemplating and mimicking the
_logical and mathematical methods_ of uncovering the _truth_.
Wherever our human limitations dictate that certainty is unfeasible or
impossible to achieve for the time being, the _scientific method_
seems to me as a legitimate and important provision.

Although, as a _self-taught_ individual I'm interested in a wide range
of intellectual disciplines, I have particularly strong interest in
_Logic_, _Mathematics_, _Computer Science_, and _Physics_.  On the
other hand, some of the humanities fields, like _Philosophy_ and
_Music_, are also appreciated by me.  However, I'm an amateur in these
areas having chosen to pursue career as a _computer programmer_
because of my long standing affinity with computers and mathematics.
