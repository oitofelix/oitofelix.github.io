## About me

![oitofelix's informal face](/images/oitofelix-informal-face.jpg)

My name is _Bruno Félix Rezende Ribeiro_.  I'm a computer programmer,
system administrator, GNU hacker and free software activist.  I'm
vegetarian, atheist and an adept of the full-blooded Platonism school
of thought.  I was born on September 12, 1989, in _Uberlândia_, a
municipality in the state of _Minas Gerais_, _Brazil_.

There are two main _virtues_ in _life_ that I consider of paramount
importance: _knowledge_ and _goodwill_.  In all aspects of my life, as
long as I'm aware of, I pursue the former for the betterment of my own
self and uphold the latter for the sake of _community_ and _fairness_.
Learning is a process of _discipline_ and _humility_: one needs
discipline to learn by oneself and humility to learn from others.
Those are, consequently, virtues which I highly value.  Moreover, in
my humble opinion, contributing to the improvement of human _social
welfare_ is a _moral duty_ of every capable person, and thus, I make
it one of my main goals.  In order to achieve it the solidity of
knowledge must be applied, albeit with _wisdom_ and attention to the
whole extension of the _ethical precepts_ of goodwill, one of which is
_freedom_.  Only with it we can have a healthy community and ground
the basis of _justice_.  Hence, for me, many aspects of life revolve
around _liberty_, what explains my strong stance on software user's
freedom.

I'm a devotee of _reason_ and _evidence_, and have fostered my
analytical and abstract thinking by contemplating and mimicking the
_logical and mathematical methods_ of uncovering the _truth_.
Wherever our human limitations dictate that certainty is unfeasible or
impossible to achieve for the time being, the _scientific method_
appears to me as a legitimate and important provision.  I enjoy pretty
much all kinds of _problem-solving_ exercises, in special those whose
solution doesn't exist and the solver must fallback to the
_meta-resolution_ of proving it as such.  Interesting enough, the
completeness of knowledge seems to me as intrinsically interconnected
within itself, making most matters corelated at some non-trivial
level.

Although, as a _self-taught_ _knowledge-lover_ individual I'm
interested in a wide range of intellectual disciplines, I have a
particularly strong interest in _Logic_, _Mathematics_, _Computer
Science_, and _Physics_.  On the other hand, several of the humanities
fields, like _Philosophy_, _Politics_, _Law_, _Music_ and
_Literature_, are also appreciated by me.  However, I'm an amateur in
all those areas having chosen to pursue career as a _computer
programmer_ and _system administrator_ because of my long standing
affinity with computers.
