	  <h2>Funding</h2>

	  <p>
	    All my work as a free software programmer, translator and
	    activist is voluntary.  You can support it by making a
	    donation.  I appreciate contributions of any size –
	    donations enable me to spend more time working for the
	    free software community.  If you'd like to make a
	    donation, of any value, please send it to the following
	    Bitcoin address:
	  </p>

	  <p><sample>17s4tPeZqHrKGpLyhSmoWciD2po8RCbAxt</sample></p>

	  <p>
	    Unfortunately I can’t offer you tax deduction, but for all
	    donations over <em>0.05 BTC</em>, I’d be happy to
	    recognize your contribution in the donors table below.  If
	    you want recognition, please send a mail
	    to <a href="mailto:oitofelix@riseup.net">oitofelix@riseup.net</a>
	    with the name and email you wish to be listed and the
	    value you've contributed.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    If you happen to need skilled labor to make particular
	    improvements in a free software package, work as a system
	    administrator, webmaster, translator or to provide
	    technical assistance, and think I'd be a good fit, please
	    don't hesitate to contact me.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    <strong>Thanks for your support!</strong>
