## Simple Scripts to Make Life Easier

In this page I publish some scripts I wrote (mostly Bash scripts) that
I consider worthwhile for automating day-to-day tasks.  These in
conjunction with my [ELPA](elpa/) form the basis of my efforts in
realizing my ideal-pragmatical computing environment: a Lisp-Unix
symbiosis; specifically, GNU Emacs driving (and being driven by) all
other components of a GNU-based system.

Usually my free software work is released under GNU GPLv3+, but short
scripts (under 300 lines total) by contrast, customarily carry a GNU
all-permissive license --- as recommended by the FSF.
